<p>Cub3D is project in 42 School in which we make a 3D game. For this game we take references from Wolfenstein game.</p>
<p>While doing project you learn how raycasting works, modificating picture pixels and a lot of math calculations.</p>
<p>For project we are allowed to use Minilibx library and all functions from math.h library. That makes project a bit harder.</p>
<p>The project needs to be done in team of two.</p>
